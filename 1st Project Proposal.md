Boston Housing

Description

The Boston housing market is highly competitive, and we want to be the best real estate agent in the area. To compete with our peers, we decide to use a few basic machine learning concepts to assist us and a client with finding the best selling price for their home. Fortunately, we have come across the Boston Housing dataset which contains aggregated data on various features for houses in Greater Boston communities. Our task is to build an optimal model based on a statistical analysis with the tools available. This model will then be used to estimate the best selling price for your clients' homes.

Data

The modified Boston housing dataset consists of 490 data points, with each datapoint having 3 features. This dataset is a modified version of the Boston Housing dataset found on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Features

RM: average number of rooms per dwelling LSTAT: percentage of population considered lower status PTRATIO: pupil-student ratio by town Target Variable 4. MEDV: median value of owner-occupied homes

Problems :

We would like to build a model using linear regression algorithm to be able to make accurate corrections for the median value of homes using features of the Boston Housing Data Set.
